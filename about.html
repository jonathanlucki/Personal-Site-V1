        <p>Hello! My name is Jonathan Lucki and I am currently in my 2A term studying Computing and Financial Management at the University of Waterloo.</p>
        <p>This is my first term studying as a CS major. Up until now, I actually studied Mathermatics/Accountancy. I discovered however that accounting and business courses are <em>horrendously</em> boring. As a result - I now study CS! Wow!!
        <p>You are currently browsing my personal website. On this site you have access to my projects, my resume, my photography, and my contact details. Feel free to look around!</p>
        <h4>Here are some things I'm interested in:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li style="margin: 10px 0;">
                <strong><em>Photography: </em></strong>I am not a professional photographer and do not own fancy equipment - that being said - I do really enjoy taking many many bad photos with my phone. Uusually over 100 per day. Very very <i>occasionally</i>, a few turn out okay. You can view some of my photos by visiting the 'photos' page. The background photo of this website was taken on the Bernese Oberland Railway in Switzerland.
            </li>
            <li style="margin: 10px 0;">
                <strong><em>English Literature: </em></strong>Unlike what you might expect from a computer science student, English was one of my best subjects in high school. I particularly enjoy short stories for their ability to better focus more on its message and less on plot. If you are in the need of a good read, The Twenty-seventh Man by Nathan Englander is absolutely fantastic.
            </li>
            <li style="margin: 10px 0;">
                <strong><em>Transit Networks/Maps: </em></strong>I am <em>very</em> into maps. In particular, my favourite is transit maps. I like everything that has to do with the transportation and movement of people and in particular their networks. If you would like to send me any cool maps please do!
            </li>
            <li style="margin: 10px 0;">
                <strong><em>Photo Colourization: </em></strong>A few years ago I started using my Photoshop skills to colour old black and white photos by request. I cannot however post them here as they are still technically other peoples private photographs. If you're interested in getting a photo colourized you can ask me about it.
